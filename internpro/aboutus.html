    <h1>>>Steps to be followed</h1><br>

<h2>1.DREAM IT</h2>
<p>Firstly,We make the learners to be clear with their dream or goal.And we guide them to dream of the possibilities for yourself , yourself your
family and for others.</p><br>

<h2>2.BELIEVE IT</h2>

 <p>Your dream needs to be big .It needs to be something that is beyond your capabilities.But it also must be believable.Though it is a big dream 
if certain things take place, or if you work hard enough,it can be still be done.But we should not loose our hope.
</p><br>

<h2>3. TELL IT</h2>
 <p>One reason many dreams never go anywhere is because the dreamer keeps it all to himself. The one who wants to achieve their dream must
tell that dream to many people.Because as we continually ssay it,we begin to believe it more and more.When we told others,it spurs us on  
to actually doing it so we don't lock foolish.</p><br>

<h2>4.PLAN IT .</h2>

<p>Every dream must have a plan .There is quoto "Get what you plan"is so true.Your dream won't just happen you plan on a regular basis and plan
out the strategy for achieving the dream.Set a time table for accomplishing each task on your 'dream plan'.
</p><br>

<h2>5.WORK IT .</h2>
<p>Successful are usually the hardest workers.There is an equation your short-term tasks,multiplied by time, equal to your long-term 
accomplishments.If you work on it each day, eventually you will achieve your dream.
</p><br>

<h2>6.ENJOY IT.</h2>
<p>When you have reached your goal and you are living your dream,be sure to enjoy it.Thank youself and give a huge reward when you get there.
Be gracious and generous.<p>
